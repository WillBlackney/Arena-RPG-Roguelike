    phrase: Stress increases in combat when negative things happen, and decreases
      when positive things happen. The more stressed a character becomes, the more
      their combat effectiveness declines. Character's that reach 100 stress become
      shattered. Shattered characters cannot take any action, and have a chance to
      suffer a heart attack and die at the start of each turn.
