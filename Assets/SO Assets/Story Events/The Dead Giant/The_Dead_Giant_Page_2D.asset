  pageDescription: "The orc your travelling with step forward begins speaking to
    Mork in orcish. Mork listens intently with a suspicious stare that eventually
    softens into a look of astonishment.\n\n\"Arku... krok Mogrash?...\"\n\nYour
    orcish companion nods.\n\n\"Arku STORK krok Mogrash?...\" says Mork in disbelief.
    Your companion replies...\n\n\"Wehsa, ki erk krok Mogrash\". \n\nAfter a brief
    pause, your companion and Mork begin to sob. Mork motions for your companion
    to come closer for a hug, and the two embrace and comfort each, sniffling and
    crying softly. After what feels like an eternity, their embrace breaks, and Mork
    stands to wipe his eyes and address you.\n\n\"Im sorry little ones, go on through
    if ya still want. No fee or trouble, i promise...\".\n\nMork steps aside, and
    you quickly hurry down before he changes his mind... what the fuck was all that
    about?!?\n"
