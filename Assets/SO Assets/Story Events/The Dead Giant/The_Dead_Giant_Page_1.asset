  pageDescription: 'Your party enters what was once a magnificent feasting hall.
    Old dusty banners and shields flank the walls of the large open hall that is
    so long you cannot see through the darkness to the end. Making your way through,
    you begin to hear a faint, gutteral muttering that grows louder as you move through
    the darkness. Upon reaching the end, you see a gigantic orc skeleton, complaining
    to itself as it rumages through the belongings of small pile of freshly slain
    adventurers. Upon noticing you, the undead orc stops its muttering and gives
    you a warm, toothy smile.


    "Allo allo, beautiful night tonight, ain''t it?
    The names Mork, how do ya do?".


    Unsure of what to make this flirtatious
    undead giant, you start moving towards the door, but the orc quickly jumps to
    feet, slides to the doorway, and blocks your path.


    "Woah woah woah, not
    so fast fellas. Dis door be Mork''s door, an'' dif if you wanna be passing Mork''s
    door, then you gotta be payin'' Mork''s fee!"...'
