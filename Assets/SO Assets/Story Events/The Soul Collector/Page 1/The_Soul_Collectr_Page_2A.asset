  pageDescription: "Abandoning all reason, you agree to the figure's offer with a
    nod of the head. The figure's wicked grin widens and evaporates back into a black
    smoke. The smoke surges forward and encircles you with great speed, seeping through
    your eyes, nose and mouth with a stench so horrid you can barely breathe. \n\nAs
    quickly as it came, the black smoke receeds back through the walls, leaving you
    with a feeling of emptiness... as well as a gigantic pile of gold!\n\n"
