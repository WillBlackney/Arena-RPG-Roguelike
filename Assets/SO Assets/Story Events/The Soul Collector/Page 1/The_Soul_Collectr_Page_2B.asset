  pageDescription: "Before the figure can finish it's pitch, one of your companions
    yells out from behind you, pointing defiantly at the creature.\n\n\"SEND THIS
    FOUL BEAST BACK TO THE ABYSS!\".\n\nThe creature lets out an unnerving, hysterical
    laugh that echoes around the room. Without a moment of hesistation, your companion
    triumpantly lunges forward and grabs the creature by the head with both hands,
    uttering a prayer that quickly escalates into a yell. The creature's unnerving
    laughter stops, and it begins screeching so loud and horrifically that it hurts
    your ears. \n\nAs your companion continues to yell out the prayer, the creature
    writhes in pain faster and faster, until finally exploding into a plume of black
    smoke, leaving only it's hooded robe behind. "
