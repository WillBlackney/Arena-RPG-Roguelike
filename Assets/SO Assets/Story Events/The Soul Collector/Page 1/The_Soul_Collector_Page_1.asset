  pageDescription: "As you continue down a corridor, a cold chill flashes over you.
    Black smoke begins slowly billowing out of the floor all around you, amalgamating
    into a hooded figure standing before you. From under it's hood, two red eyes
    star back at you, and through the the thick black smoke you notice an over-sized,
    toothy grin full of jagged teeth. \n\n\"Fear me not, delicate fleshling... a
    simple exchange is all i offer, a true bargain really...a taste of my power,
    for a taste of your soul...\"."
