  pageDescription: 'You kneel before the fountain, place your hands on the bowl,
    and sing a prayer. As you finish your heavenly hymn, a glowing orb of pure light
    appears at the roof, gently illuminating and warming the room as it moves slowly
    down towards you. As soon as the orb touches your forehead, you feel an intense
    burning as all the cuts and bruises on your body instantly cauterize and heal.
    A mysterious, soothing voice repeats in your head, slowly fading....


    "Stray
    not from the path... Trust not the usurper..."


    What could that mean?...
