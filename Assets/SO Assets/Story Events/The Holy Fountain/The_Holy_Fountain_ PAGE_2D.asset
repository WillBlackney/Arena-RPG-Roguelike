  pageDescription: 'You hover your hand over the fountain and recite a dark prayer.
    As you recite the words, a dark plume of smoke slowly wafts downwards from your
    hand towards the bowl. As the smoke mixes with the water, the marble of the fountain
    blackens and cracks, and you hear what sounds like a chorus of angels screaming
    out in agony. Removing your hand, you notice an ominous glowing stone floating
    on the surface of the corrupted water.


    The paladin in your company looks
    completely appalled, staring at you as if you''d just murdered a litter of kittens.


    Better
    get moving before he starts crying...'
