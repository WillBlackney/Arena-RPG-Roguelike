  pageDescription: "Your close your eyes and bite down in preparation for the pain.
    As fast as you can, you snatch each item from the pool, trying your best to ignore
    the smell of your own burning flesh. After taking a third item, you fall back
    in agony, clutching your arm and shaking uncontrollably. \n\nAfter a brief moment
    of respite, you inspect the damage done to what used to be your arm. Blisters
    and blood cover your arm from fingers to shoulder, with chunks of flesh dropping
    off and exposing bone. \n\nBetter get moving, some one probably heard all that
    screaming..."
