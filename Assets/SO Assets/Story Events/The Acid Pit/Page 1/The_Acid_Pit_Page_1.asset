  pageDescription: "As you turn a corner around a corridor, you almost step into
    what appears to be a small pool of acid. On closer inspection, you notice some
    weapons and armour resting at the bottom of the pool: perhaps they belonged to
    a clumsy adventurer who fell in! \n\nWhile the prospect of a severe chemical
    burn causes you to pause in trepidation, you feel condifent that you could snatch
    something up from the bottom before your arm burns..."
