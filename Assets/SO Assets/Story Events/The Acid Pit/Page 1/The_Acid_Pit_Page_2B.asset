  pageDescription: 'With gritted teeth, you plunge your hand into the acid and pull
    out the first thing you feel. Wincing as you reach back in again, the burning
    pain quickly becomes more intense. You pull out the second item and drop it next
    to you before falling back and clutching your arm in agony. Your entire arm from
    fingers to elbow is blistered and bloody.


    Ouch!'
